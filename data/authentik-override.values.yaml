# Use this file to override authentik defaults.
# Only common options are proposed here. Lookup all options in the defaults file.

# CAUTION:
# The following values are touched by Terraform - changes to them will probably be overwritten:

# The authentik version (image.tag) is handled by terraform
# The authentik secret (authentik.secret) is generated by terraform
# The postgresql.enabled is injected by terraform via postgres_enabled variable
# If authentik chart build in postgres is enabled, postgres user, db and pass are generated by terraform
# The ingress hosts entry (ingress.hosts) is extended by terraform
# The ingress tls entry (ingress.tls) is extended by terraform
# The ingress annotations entry (ingress.annotations) is extended by terraform

########################

# This is controlled by the postgresql_enabled terraform variable. Set it to false, if you want to configure an external postgres instead of enabling the included postgres. Changing it here has no effect!
postgresql:
  enabled: true

# Disable this, if you want to configure an external redis instead of enabling the included redis
redis:
  enabled: true

# Configure authentik
authentik:
  # You will most likely want to enable ingress - the annotations, tls and hosts entries will be extended by terraform
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations: {}
    hosts: []
    tls: []

  # You will most likely want to customize email settings here
  # email:

  #   port: 25
  #   timeout: 30
  #   username: ''
  #   password: ''
  #   use_ssl: false
  #   use_tls: false

  # You may want to configure an external postgres here
